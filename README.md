#1. Two player chess, using QT/unreal GUI.
A chessboard class will form the background layer. THe parent chesspiece class and its eight inherited piece classes form the pieces. Check conditions need to be implemented into the King piece. The entire program is arranged and executed by a Game class, which handles most of the visual interface.

#Edit1:Added simple graphics view architecture, and background scene.

#Edit2:Added check conditions for king and a parent class 'chesspiece' for implementing future individual piece classes.

#Edit3:Added game class which handles gameplay and user interface.

#Edit4:Added chessboard.cpp,chessboard.h,main.cpp. Chessboard adds the black and white chesspeices and draws the board.Main.cpp starts the game
